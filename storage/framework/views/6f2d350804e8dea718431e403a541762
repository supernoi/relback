											Creation and implementation of centralized environment management and monitoring databases using 
											Oracle Enterprise Manager (Cloud 12c and 10g Grid) This environment currently manages 120 instances 
											sending notifications criticism for SNMP traps, SMS and email.
										</p>

											Based on these characteristics, professionally really I consider myself proactive, 
											not just as a beautiful term used in an interview, but enough to get bothered with 
											recurrent problems happening in environments where job. I always try to solve these 
											problems even when it is the responsibility of other sectors, or I strive suppliers 
											to demonstrate that the environment can be improved and when I have knowledge on the 
											subject suggest the solution that can be applied and when I do not try to learn about it. ..
										</p>
										<p>
											Currently work as a Database Administrator primarily focused on meeting demands 
											environments with Oracle Databases 10g and 11g (single instance and RAC) and 
											operating systems RedHat and Solaris, but also attend less frequently demands of 
											SQL Server and MySQL ... I have used a lot OEM Cloud Control 12c for administration 
											and monitoring the day to day ...

											As this should be a summary. I am a person dedicated to improving the environments 
											they attend to people who use them may also make its activities quickly and thus help
